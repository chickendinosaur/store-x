# Description  

Simple and fast application state management system.

## Goal

- No dependencies.
- Similar api/functionality to Redux.
- Do not force creating a state copy to update state.
- OOD design for extensibility.

## Thoughts

Why the name Storex? Because it's a store where 'x' can be anything and had to have an 'x' in the name to be as cool as the other guys.

## Performance  

### @chickendinosaur/storex

npm run benchmark  

new Store(reducer, initialState) x 19,719,847 ops/sec  
.dispatchAction(action) x 19,714,141 ops/sec  

### redux

node benchmarks/redux.js  

.createStore(reducer, initialState) x 815,745 ops/sec  
.dispatch(action) x 1,021,774 ops/sec  
.dispatch(action) /w Object.assign x 671,355 ops/sec

# Getting Started  

## Installation

#### npm  

npm install @chickendinosaur/storex

## Usage

#### Basic:

The store will only run state subscribers/listeners if state is return from a
reducer callback.

```javascript
import { Store, Reducer } from '@chickendinosaur/storex';
// Base action.
import Action from '@chickendinosaur/storex/action';
// Pre-made actions can be found in '@chickendinosaur/storex/actions'
import TransactionAction from '@chickendinosaur/storex/actions/transaction';

var initialState = {
	a: 1,
	b: 'b',
	c: 'c'
};

var reducer = new Reducer({
	a: function (state, action) {
		if (action.status === 'success') {
			state.a = action.payload.updated;
			return state;
		}
	}
});

var listener = function (state) {
	console.log('State listener called.');
};

var store = new Store(reducer, initialState);

store.addReducer(reducer);
store.addStateListener(listener);
store.dispatchAction(new TransactionAction('a', {
		updated: true
	}),
	'success');
store.removeReducer(reducer);
store.removeSubscriber(listener);
```

#### Creating a fresh state:

Returning a new object from a reducer callback set's the store state.

```javascript
// From a reducer.
var reducer = new Reducer({
	a: function (state, action) {
		return {
			a: 'newA'
		}
	}
});
```
